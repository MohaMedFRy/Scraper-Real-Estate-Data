The Main Idea of this project is to predict the price of real estate dependent on our collected data. 

Steps: 
  • We scraped Real estate data from some websites like Tageer, olx, Opensouq, Semsar, and Property Finder 
  • Collected the result of scraping and made some similarities for merging them. 
  • then cleaned our results before analyzing and interpreting them. 
  • Make a Regression model using machine learning. (predictive model)  
  • Built dashboards and visualizations using Power BI, which helped the organization gain insights into its operations and performance
